Things I learnt in my college:
1. I'm not a genius
2. I'm not too bad at making friends
3. I don't remember much of my past incidents and share a very few
4. It's not too easy to chase your dreams
5. Happiness is when shared
6. It's not weird to masturbate too many times or watch porn
7. I'm very bad at making conversations or explaining things
